# Bank-login
Allows user to login to bank account if correct PIN is entered.


Create a program that allows a user to login to their bank account if they enter their personal
identification number (PIN). Their PIN is a 4 digit number with a value of 1234. If the user
enters the incorrect value for the PIN they will be given an error message and asked to enter their
PIN again. The program will continue to prompt the user for their PIN until the user enters the
correct value or until they have tried three times. If the user is successful in the first three
attempts they should be given a message informing them that they have successfully accessed
their account. After three failed attempts, the user should be informed that they will not be able
to access their account because the user is only given three chances to enter their PIN
